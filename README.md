## Infrastructure Setup

### Components

- **Grafana** : Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It provides tools to visualize, analyze, and alert on data from various sources, including metrics, logs, and traces.
  
- **Jaeger** : Jaeger is an open-source distributed tracing system used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based architectures. It helps trace the flow of requests across various services to identify performance bottlenecks and failures.
  
- **Prometheus** : Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects and stores time-series data, providing powerful querying capabilities and alerting ; collect metrics from various sources using pull-based mechanisms. Supports exporters and integrations for different systems.

- **Loki** : Loki is an open-source log aggregation system designed to work seamlessly with Grafana. It collects and stores logs, allowing for efficient querying and visualization of log data.

### Docker Compose Configuration

The observability stack is deployed using Docker Compose, featuring a robust setup that includes Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki. This configuration ensures comprehensive monitoring and tracing capabilities.
To maintain data integrity and ensure durability across container restarts, persistent data storage is configured using Docker volumes. This setup leverages bind mounts to ensure that critical data, such as logs, metrics, and tracing information, is preserved and accessible, even after containers are stopped or restarted

### Service Instrumentation


#### What is Service Instrumentation?

Service instrumentation integrates observability tools into our services to collect and report metrics, traces, and logs. This process allows for better monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimization of our services.

#### What is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is an open-source framework that provides APIs, libraries, and agents for collecting and exporting observability data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It is designed to provide consistent and interoperable observability data across various platforms and technologies.

#### Key Components:

- **Metrics Collection**: Captures quantitative data like response times, error rates, and resource utilization to monitor service performance and detect anomalies.

- **Tracing**: Tracks the flow of requests through the application, providing visibility into interactions between services and identifying performance bottlenecks.

- **Logging**: Records detailed logs to offer context for troubleshooting and debugging specific events within the service.

#### Benefits:

- **Enhanced Visibility**: Gain a comprehensive view of the `poli` applicationâ€™s performance and behavior through detailed metrics, traces, and logs.

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Detect and address issues such as latency and resource constraints as they occur.

- **Efficient Troubleshooting**: Use tracing and logging to quickly identify and resolve errors and performance issues.

- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Utilize metrics and traces to guide decisions on scaling, optimization, and service improvements.

- **Proactive Alerts**: Set up alerts based on metrics and logs to preemptively address potential issues.

- **Compliance and Reporting**: Maintain detailed logs and metrics for audits and compliance purposes.

- **Improved User Experience**: Optimize performance by identifying and addressing bottlenecks.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Cloning and Building**:
   - Cloned the `poli` application from its repository:
    
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/shzlw/poli.git
   ```

   - Build the application using Docker :

   ```bash
   cd poli
   docker build -t poli . 
   ```

3. **OpenTelemetry Configuration**:
   - Configured the OpenTelemetry SDK inside the `config` package [OpenTelemetryConfiguration.java](https://github.com/mmhamdi/src/main/java/com/shzlw/poli/OpenTelemetryConfiguration.java) of the `poli` application:
     - **OpenTelemetry SDK Bean**:
       - **`OpenTelemetrySdk`**: Configured with tracing, logging, and metrics components.
       - **Tracer Provider**: Uses `SdkTracerProvider` with two span processors:
         - **Jaeger Exporter**: Sends traces to Jaeger for visualization.
         - **Logging Span Exporter**: Outputs trace information to logs for debugging.
       - **Log Emitter Provider**: Uses `SdkLogEmitterProvider` to send logs to an OTLP endpoint.
       - **Context Propagators**: Configured to use the W3C Trace Context for trace propagation.

    ```bash
    @Configuration
    public class OpenTelemetryConfiguration {
    @Bean
    public OpenTelemetrySdk getOpenTelemetry (){
        Resource serviceNameResource =
                Resource.create(Attributes.of(ResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME, "poli"));
        OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder openTelemetrySdkBuilder = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()
                .setTracerProvider(
                        SdkTracerProvider.builder()
                                .addSpanProcessor(SimpleSpanProcessor.create(getJaegerExporter()))
                                .addSpanProcessor(SimpleSpanProcessor.create(LoggingSpanExporter.create()))
                                .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(serviceNameResource))
                                .build())
                .setLogEmitterProvider(
                        SdkLogEmitterProvider.builder()
                        .addLogProcessor(SimpleLogProcessor.create(getOtlpLogExporter()))
                        .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(serviceNameResource))
                        .build())
                .setPropagators(ContextPropagators.create(W3CTraceContextPropagator.getInstance()));
        return openTelemetrySdkBuilder.buildAndRegisterGlobal();
    }
    ``` 
   - Integrated OpenTelemetry with Jaeger for tracing, Prometheus for metrics.

By combining service instrumentation with OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki, this project ensures a robust and comprehensive observability solution that enhances the reliability and performance of the `poli` application.
